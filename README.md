# Note Taker Starter Code

WHEN the user opens the Note Taker app they presented with the landing page. 
THEN when Get Started is clicked, the user presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
WHEN a new note is entered a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page and when the user clicks on the Save icon the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
WHEN the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column that note appears in the right-hand column.
WHEN I click on the add note icon (+) in the navigation at the top of the page the user is presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
